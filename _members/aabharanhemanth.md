### Story: 

I was always interested in making things, and I struggled a lot in figuring out how to do the things I wanted to do. Spent years Researching (Googling things), trying to make things and often failing at the things I wanted to do. Most important lesson learnt: Its not as easy as it looks.

### Achievements : 

1. National and state level CBSE science fair winner, Along with Adhesh Shenoy 
2. Kairos Fellow
3. Won Bosch I3 in 12th, along with Gautam Padiyar and Adhesh Shenoy

### Projects: 

1. Scratch built and flew RC aircrafts (2012) - was a huge learning experience, aircraft crashed multiple times.
2. Built a Peltier electric water condenser along with Adhesh Shenoy, that allowed us to draw water from the atmosphere, took this to the CBSE science fair. (2013)
3. Built a virtual reality headset as a part of KHMD
4. Smart Dustbin : Built a prototype of a dustbin that accomplishes 2 new things. 1. Helps user subconsciously segregate waste by designing the bin itself in that way. 2. Letâ€™s the cleaning staff track a network of dustbin hence reducing commute time and resources. Done in association with Reap Benefit (May 2015)
5. Started up a design firm; 'Keno design' - No longer functional (2014)
6. Worked with Reap Benefit on some Arduino and sensor based innovation like a smart water flow meter, and design solutions for mapping switches to their appliances. (June 2016 - current)
