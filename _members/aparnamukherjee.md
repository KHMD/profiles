### Story: 

I've been writing and drawing since I was 5, and I've never taken an art class in my life. I am passionate about discovering new things and euphoria is solving math problems for hours to rock music. (Heck yeah) 
At 12 I had my first tryst with a creative profession thanks to the Duke TiP summer studies program at Infosys, Mysore where I studied architecture for three weeks and the metaphorical blood was upon the beasts lips because this was it. (!)
Till I was 14, my digital art was unaided by the blessing that is a graphics tablet. 
I also love studying languages, and with German as my second language, I've had the privilege of two visits to Germany - the first on scholarship for language course of three weeks and the second to represent India at the International German Olympiad at Berlin. 
Aided by YouTube and tons and tons of Photoshop and Illustrator help books I try as best as I can to weave ideas into something more.

### Achievements : 

Selected to attend the Duke TiP summer studies three week course at Infosys, Mysore as an asset talent scholar 
2. Scholarship to study German for three weeks at Sankt Peter Ording
