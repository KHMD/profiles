### Story: 

I have always had a close relation with science & technology and it starts off way back, in the first Computer class, where everything was great (I knew all the theory) but soon things went out of hand and turned for the worse and I was not selected for the first IT-Fair of my batch, I felt torn-apart and after a lot of hard work and effort I convinced my Computer teacher that I would improve,and to give me a slot for that IT-Fair and thankfully I got,one to show off my projects, and from then on, I have never looked back and I was always the very first person who got selected for every IT Fair thereafter and whenever the things became tough, I didn't give up and overcame all difficulties ahead, I made sure all I did had somethings people hadn't seen or expected to see before in normal school projects (The USP), something to push the boundaries of how amazing projects can be, and so I added more realism and professionalism to my work and I never let any of my projects be released when they were just good ... they needed to be great.  I learnt how to make programs fool proof from my father when I was learning QBasic and was the only one who was able to work on QB64 when others were still getting the hang of QBasic and the only one who used bootstrap and other CSS solutions to make my Namma-Bengaluru page for The last IT-Fair (the one before the first INTERFACE) and amazed everyone in the crowd that day. I displayed a Cleanster Bot (made by LEGO Mindstorms) at the science fair and an app for first aid and accessing emergency services, and even made an app for helping , and connecting artisans and craftsmen to consumers and NGOs for my Eqube SAP Project which was selected to be one of the best projects form 10th grade. I tried to make my own smartphone (which I had designed from group-up) and year back and was almost able to seal a deal form Qualcomm for their current generation Snapdragon 820 Chips, but due to my age I could not get an NDA. I won the award for the 3B science project in 9th grade for my Science Behind Magic Project. Using Science & Technology to help people has always been something I love to do.

### Achievements : 

Won the first ever INTERFACE iQuiz
Won in the creative category in Creya Ignited Minds Challenge
Won the award for the 3B science project in 9th grade for my Science Behind Magic Project.

### Projects: 

1. Xbox-Winbox-101
A website that was to lobby for Microsoft to make its Xbox and Windows 10 gaming pool one, and release all its games on both platforms. I had built this idea 2 years ago and now it sits actually happening ! Microsoft is launching many of its Xbox exclusive games on Windows 10 as well. Its really good to know that an idea that I made into a website 2 years ago's purpose is actually coming true now, by none other than the Redmond Giant Microsoft. Also this project was hosted with a great cloud services company, CrownCloud, who were also in support of my idea.
2. Cleanster Bot
A robot made form LEGO Mindstorms NXT that cleans floors clean and dry, it has also been published on the Lego website and won 4 out of five stars on their website.
3. India Arts Network
An Android App that I had made for my SAP Project that would help connect artisans and craftsmen directly to consumers and NGOs cutting out the middlemen in the system today. It was completed and I also went to Chitrakala Parishad to show off the App which they praised very much and were proud to see that students of today were taking the initiative to save our country's rich culture and heritage.
4. First Aid App
An Android app I had made for the science fair that would help people do the correct procedures in case of the requirement of first aid, and would also immediately connect them to emergency services nearby. The app was completed.
5. PowerCore OS 
A Linux distro which I made in 7th grade for workstations aimed at creators and innovators, which I use today as well (perfectly updated just so you know), it has all the latest packages and uses kde for UI and runs on top of centOS.
5. Smart Garbage Segregator
A machine centered around a conveyor belt that would separate garbage first by the normal methods but then using cameras, spectrum analysis and chemical reactions it would identify the materials and separate them effectively. It could not be made as the cost to make a prototype is high and I am too far away from SP Road (the electronics heaven ... I know), but the theory is rock solid even today.
6. Android Web OS
A website cum OS that looks just like Android Marshmallow (when I was making it, it was still called just M), it was to simulate how it would be if all devices were just windows to powerhouses in server farms, away from you, and all you needed were these simple windows (aka a great piece of metal or glass with a display, camera, sensors and speakers etc, but no processor). It was successful but could not be completed as rewriting the whole of Android to JavaScript and PHP and other web languages is not easy to do.
7. An Alpha Stage AI Bot
Its completely written by me in C++ and is still under the works but is working well, for tasks it had code to work with to perform the needed action but the real challenge is to make it learn efficiently by itself, write code and tune code for itself each time it learns something new (or its mistakes) and make sure it does the right thing next time.
8. Car Racing Game In Unreal Engine 4
This is a bare bones car racing game (for today's standards) made in UE4, with 6 cars, including yours, with 3 tracks and a night time one as well. 
9. Made The INTERFACE (2016) website and gave the name INTERFACE V2.0 instead of INTERFACE 2016
I made the website completely from ground up and the code is available on the KHMD repository or on my own repository on Github as well, its built with material design and modern elements in mind, it supports emoji (very few websites do) and everything on it was customized using online open-source software and services to be brilliant as well as accessible.
10. Built my own custom Android N ROM for my own phone, but due to unstabilitily of the CyanogenMod sources I switched back to Oxygen OS, but I still continue my efforts to make a cool Android ROM like Paranoid Android or Remix OS or CyanogenMod itself.
11. Tried getting G Suite for education for KHMD last year and work is still underway.
