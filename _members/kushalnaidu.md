### Story: 

I have always been fascinated by how simple statements are all that is needed to make a computer do what you want. I have always been fascinated about programing from the time I learnt logo and qbasic, about 7 years ago. I have started attending meetups and talks on topics such as Artificial intelligence which is something i am very interested in.

### Achievements : 

Completed a nanodegree in Machine Learning from Udacity <https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009> Machine Learning 

### Projects: 

1. Morse code in text format into a .wav sound file (12th grade project)
2. Developed a prediction algorithm which determines whether a student needs early intervention or not based on about 30 input features using supervised learning methods, based on a dataset found in <http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/>UCI Machine learning repository</a>
3. Developed a reinforcement learning algorithm to help a smartcab figure out the fastest, safest path from its location to the destination.
4. Used data analysis methods to analyse and to find the best possible complexity of the algorithm to predict housing prices in boston, also based on a dataset found in <http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/> UCI Machine learning repository</a>
