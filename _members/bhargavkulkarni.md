### Story: 

KHMD is where my story or at least the most relevant part of life started. It allowed me to explore the world in terms of tech, science and innovation. Through KHMD I was able to get an idea of programming, building web-pages as well as how to use the arduino. I also started taking part in various science fairs like CBSE National Science fair and so on. I also began understanding a lot on ideation and it has now become my biggest strength. 

### Achievements : 

Qualified for the CBSE National Science Fair 


### Projects: 

1. Built the hot wire cutter in 8th along with Ish Bosamiya and Sai Anirudh. Also made a failed Stirling Engine (almost worked).
2. Made a prototype of a 3D Printing Pen in 10th.
3. Designed and built a weather and soil analysis machine along with Ish Bosamiya that made it to CBSE National Science Fair.
4. Trying to make a prototype to allow the blind to see, itâ€™s crazy I know.
5. Working Stirling Engine with self made design
