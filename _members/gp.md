# Gautam Padiyar

Batch: Class of 2016. Studied from 6th to 12th

Current place of study : Shiv Nadar University

#### Story (optional): 

I was a hardcore android root user who eventually wanted to build a Custom ROM. Tried and failed miserably and took up android programming. Learnt Android really slowly and did only copy-paste coding for a few years. Slowly started understanding what I was doing and started attending various events and workshops like Design Day, BMOSC, Google I/O extended, Google Devfest, HackIndia Hackathon, and technology meetups all over Bangalore. Started KHMD with the idea of collaboration that cut across typical peer groups. 

#### Achievements : 

Winning Bosch i3

#### Projects(Most important): 

1. Simple Android app to help deaf and hearing impaired people communicate effectively with the world. (Jan 2013)

2. Failed "Startup" : Tried building an app that helped doctors have access to their patients' information and communicate with them without requiring a visit. Had very little technical knowledge back then. (Dec 2013 - Sep 2014)

3. Started KHMD : Nov 2014

4. Smart Dustbin : Built a prototype of a dustbin that accomplishes 2 new things. 1. Helps user subconsciously segregate waste by designing the bin itself in that way. 2. Let's the cleaning staff track a network of dustbin hence reducing commute time and resources. Done in association with Reap Benefit (May 
2015)

5. MUN Moderator for KMUN : Built the software used for KMUN 2015 along with Aditya Venkatraman, Arjun Rao, and Sriram Desai (June 2015)

6. Bash for Windows : Built a Linux terminal that ran natively on Windows using the qt framework. A few directory commands, file manipulation commands and the entire set of man pages were available to the user. The application also intended to introduce beginners to the world of the Linux terminal using a friendly GUI instruction window. (Sep 2015 - Jan 2016)

7. Worked with Reap Benefit on their Arduino and sensor based innovation like their smart drip irrigation system. (June 2016)

8. KHMD App : Work ends in the near future. (Oct 2016)

9. Crowdsourced pothole detector for Android : Ongoing for the near future. (Sep 2016 - )

#### Past interests :

#### Present interests

Android, C and *NIX systems, machine learning, sensors and basics of pretty much everything used to build tech.
