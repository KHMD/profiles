### Story: 

I was a hardcore android root user who wanted to build a Custom ROM for my first Android phone. Tried and failed miserably and ended up learning android app development. Made extremely slow progress with android and did only copy-paste coding for more than a year. Slowly started understanding what I was doing. I attended various events and workshops like Design Day, BMOSC, Google I/O extended, Google Devfest, HackIndia Hackathon, and technology meetups all over Bangalore and that got me interested in the idea of having a community in school. Started KHMD with the idea of collaboration that cut across typical peer groups in school. 

### Achievements : 

Won Bosch i3 in 12th along with Aabharan Hemanth and Adhesh Shenoy

### Projects: 

1. Simple Android app to help deaf and hearing impaired people communicate effectively with the world. (Jan 2013)

2. Failed "Startup" : Tried building an app that helped doctors have access to their patients' information and communicate with them without requiring a visit. Had very little technical knowledge back then. (Dec 2013 - Sep 2014)

3. Started KHMD : Nov 2014

4. Smart Dustbin : Built a prototype of a dustbin that accomplishes 2 new things. 1. Helps user subconsciously segregate waste by designing the bin itself in that way. 2. Let's the cleaning staff track a network of dustbin hence reducing commute time and resources. Done in association with Reap Benefit (May 
2015)

5. MUN Moderator for KMUN : Built the software used for KMUN 2015 along with Aditya Venkatraman, Arjun Rao, and Sriram Desai (June 2015)

6. Bash for Windows : Built a Linux terminal that ran natively on Windows using the qt framework. A few directory commands, file manipulation commands and the entire set of man pages were available to the user. The application also intended to introduce beginners to the world of the Linux terminal using a friendly GUI instruction window. (Sep 2015 - Jan 2016) with Aditya Venkatraman

7. Worked with Reap Benefit on their Arduino and sensor based innovation like their smart drip irrigation system. (June 2016)

8. KHMD App : No idea what it'll become (Oct 2016 - )

9. Crowdsourced pothole detector for Android : Ongoing for the near future. (Sep 2016 - )

### Past interests :

### Present interests

Android, C and *NIX systems, machine learning, sensors and basics of pretty much everything used to build tech.
