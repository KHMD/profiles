### Story: 

Started my affinity towards technology from once I got a Gameboy Ripoff. Became a Google person when android was gaining pace. Turning point was when I was given a Samsung Galaxy Ace to play with. Started off coding with C++. Currently python is my forte. Internet of Things, Data Analysis and Machine Learning is what I’m doing nowadays(Hopefully combine all three of these things to make something). Was also into making Android Apps a while ago. Attended about 5-6 hackathons which include Siemens MakeIT Real and SocioHacks by HackerEarth.

### Achievements : 

Best Hack for “Road Safety” @ SocioHacks by HackerEarth.

### Projects: 

1. BattleShip: A game built using <graphics.h> along with Pranav Iyer. (March 2015)

2. FoodFad: An app which strives to give a personalized diet experience, providing tasty and healthy solutions using a set of inputs. Basically a recommendation engine with a tinge of Machine Learning. (Aug 2016-)

3. HairpinSaver: IoT based project using Arduino to be used in hilly areas for basic guidance of vehicles on the either side of a Hair Pin Bend. (July 2016) 

4. Head of Technology for KMUN 2016.
